                  <p>This dashboard was built out of one simple, personal desire: to prepare myself for my first eventual real estate purchase.</p>
                  <p>Being somebody that's in their 20's, it's inevitable that one eventually hits the point in their life where they ask themselves "... what's next" after renting all their adult life.
                    While I am far, far away from owning a nice little, quiet cabin somewhere deep in the woods of the upper peninsula, I figured there was no better way to plan than by building my own solution to track relevant metrics for my geographical area.

                  <p><h3>Languages:</h3> Python, SQL</p>
                  <p><h3>Visualization Tools:</h3> Pandas, NumPy, MatplotLib, PowerBI</p>
                  <p><h3>Addtl. Tools:</h3> Jupyter Notebooks, sqllite</p>
                  <!--Begin the iteration sections from here-->
                  <h1> </h1>
                  <h1>Iteration #1</h1>
                  <img id="iteration0pic" src="./Images/REDashboardPics/PowerBI_Iteration0.png" class=" img-thumbnail">
                  <p>At first, I needed to find a valuable source to either scrape or pull data from, and I managed to settle on leveraging the Zillow API first for a few select regions. As the only goal at this stage was to display at least some relevant RE data, a basic Jupyter Notebook was made
                    and data was pulled into a Python script that formatted the resulting data, stored it in a dataframe, and subsequently exported the cleaned data into a CSV file.
                  </p>
                  <p>By leveraging the power of Jupyter & the Python language, it's easy to quickly query some data and see how it looks in a visualized notebook format.
                    The only issue with this though, is that while it's really easy to be able to write your code & immediately view it in a nice "web-ui" format, any target audience
                    members who may not have a data background & thus are not familiar with the Jupyter UI may find looking at data here to be a bit cumbersome.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Iteration #2</h1>
                  <img id="iteration1pic" src="./Images/REDashboardPics/PowerBI_Iteration1.png" class=" img-thumbnail">
                  <p>Once I finished developing a rudimentary ETL process (extracting the data from the source using a Python script, cleaning it up using various scripts & testing
                    in Jupyter notebooks, pushing the data to a locally hosted SQL database, and orchestrating the execution of the script using native Microsoft tools), I was able to
                    start leveraging PowerBI to better visualize some of the data. After a few rounds of saving and testing the data in the PowerBI UI, this is what came out as the result.
                  </p>
                  <p>Basic? Yes. Brutally plain? Yes. But getting PowerBI to display at least *some* data was a journey in and of itself, so I've included what this looks like just to serve as a reminder
                    of what the first stage looked like!
                  </p>
                  <h1>Iteration #3</h1>
                  <img id="iteration2pic" src="./Images/REDashboardPics/PowerBI_Iteration2.png" class=" img-thumbnail">
                  <p>Now that the data was displayed, I was able to take a stab at displaying at least something more visually appealing. The image above details this first attempt!</p>
                  <h1>Iteration #4</h1>
                  <img id="iteration3pic" src="./Images/REDashboardPics/PowerBI_Iteration3.png" class=" img-thumbnail">
                  <p>
                    At this step in the process, I'll admit: being somebody with a more logical brain meant that I had *zero* clue on how to go about designing this project. What next, you may ask?
                    Well, this required me putting on the hat of a Product Manager, and playing the role. What did this entail? Well, the realization that end-user input would be valuable before
                    continuing to develop this project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I quickly phoned a friend, and had her give me her first initial impression. At first glance, she was able to instantly identify just how much of an eyesore the placement
                    of the elements was. Ta-da; my first feature improvement request!
                  </p>
                  <h1>Iteration #5</h1>
                  <img id="iteration5pic" src="./Images/REDashboardPics/PowerBI_Iteration5.png" class=" img-thumbnail">
                  <p>
                    Finally, I held another round of gauging user-feedback, and I realized the dashboard was missing a key functionality: sorting capabilities, and something to
                    differentiate this page vs the other page (centered around general US metrics). This screenshot is a result of this feedback loop; one that now looks much less of
                    an eyesore compared to where we started off.

                  <p>Being that I am absolutely enamored with the idea of global business, I figured it would be fun to try developing a dashboard containing very market & region-specific 
                    insights in an easy to read format. Thus, this quirky little React-powered web app was born. Was there any monetary value associated with this project? Not at all,
                    but I had a blast showcasing it to a few colleagues of mine over dinner; demonstrating the capabilities that integrating visualization tools (like PowerBI) with React
                    can bring.
                  </p>

                  <img id="iteration1picCSV" src="./Images/MarketPOCPics/MarketCSVPic.JPG" class=" img-thumbnail">
                  <p>To start, I had to generate a randomized dataset pertaining to 2 different contexts: global business, and IT asset management. Simple enough, right? Well, as I was not able to
                    find a "ready-made" dataset on the usual sites (like Kaggle), I had to use a randomizer tool that I provided a few arguments to. After that, I received a dataset, while a bit
                    dirty, that was ripe for visualization.
                  </p>
                  <p>The screenshot details just one example of the dataset that I was working with, but in order to even get it in this state, I had to leverage Python and the Pandas library
                    to clean up the columns, character-sets, and other small errors that were driving me nuts. 
                  </p>
                  <h1>Iteration #2</h1>
                  <img id="iteration2picCSV" src="./Images/MarketPOCPics/MarketDashboardPic1.JPG" class=" img-thumbnail">
                  <p>What good is a web app without an easy to use web interface? After testing 2 different variations, I settled on this design as the landing page. This decision
                    was made after having consulted a few colleagues of mine on what they would consider a "simplistic" market-facing view, and so a simple table list with the country
                    name & flag as values. 
                  </p>
                  <h1>Iteration #3</h1>
                  <img id="iteration3picCSV" src="./Images/MarketPOCPics/MarketDashboardPic2.JPG" class=" img-thumbnail">
                  <p>When we think of global business, what sorts of metrics come to mind? To get a better understanding of what the average joe would want to see, I did a few simple
                    end-user surveys amongst my small group of select colleagues, and devised a list of about 10 different bits of information. From here, I refined this list further,
                    and developed a view in my dashboard that visualized some of these. While the data above is completely falsified, it's fascinating to see just how cleanly we can visualize
                    some of this information using modern web-development technologies.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Iteration #4</h1>
                  <img id="iteration4picCSV" src="./Images/MarketPOCPics/MarketPowerBI Report.JPG" class=" img-thumbnail">
                  <p>While React is a powerful tool, sometimes it's easiest to not have to "re-invent" the wheel, and this is where tools like PowerBI come in. As I was working with
                    a handful of different CSV and JSON files w/ market-specific data, being able to use the PowerBI functionality to clean, specifiy, and merge data sources was a game changer.
                    The screenshot above demonstrates what a market-specific view within PowerBI looks like.
